        This exercise is about making lists
        <p>Here's what I like about lists:
            <ul>
                <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
                <li>That's about it</li>
                <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
            </ul>
        </p> 
        <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:
            <ol>
                <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
                <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                            <ol>
                                <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
