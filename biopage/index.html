                Hello, world! Hahaha! It's a developer joke. I hope you get it. But really, Hello. My name is Crystal and I am a new developer, an avid reader, a very poor kayaker, and the grower of many seeds with no vegetables to eat. I am glad you are here!

                A little about me....

                <h3>The beginning...</h3>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Ocala, Fl. Well, that isn't actually true. I was born in Orlando, moved briefly to Gainesville, and then was raised in Summerfield, FL. You are probably wondering, why say Ocala and not Summerfield? Well, if Ocala is a sunflower seed of a city, Summerfield is strawberry seed. And not because it is fruitful. I remember when I started my senior year of high school and we got our first stop light. It was on the way to my night class at the college and I am a constantly late person and this traffic light was the bane of my existance. Ok, so I am late, I am a failure with words...what else would someone like to know about me...

                <h3>The middle...</h3>
                <p>
                    Facts! I love facts! I got my undergrad degree at FSU with a major in Studio Art and minors in Math and Chemistry. I taught for a little while (Math and Science), got married, taught, had a baby, went back for my master's degree in Entomology (bugs, specifically Chemical Ecology of Chinch Bugs) at the University of Florida, had a baby, received my master's degree, taught, bought a business in Atlanta, ran the business, ran the business, ran the business...well, you get it. Along the way, I have, somehow, found myself as a room mom twice (both times for my son's class), copy mom once (never again!), and Girl Scout Troop Leader, i.e. six years of crafting and hanging out with the most amazing girls I know. Also, I have had the honor of leading many of those girls in a writing club (I know, I know, stick to your strengths. But nobody wants to join a math club...) that spanned three years and hundreds of pages of ridiculousness.

                <h3>The important stuff...</h3>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I like being with my husband. We are that couple. Overly dependant, always wanting to be together. We like outdoors stuff but I am terrible at all of it. I will flip a canoe and slide down every hill we hike. But my husband is light on his feet and quick to laugh, so it is always fun. I have two kids (you may have picked that up earlier) who put up with my antics, anxiety organizing, and failed gardening attempts. We also have a dog (he is seventeen and in diaper, oh lord.), a cat, and a hamster. I am blessed with two of the greatest and craziest sisters in the whole world and a dad that's kindness knows no bounds.
